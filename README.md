takeme: Frontend
===============
####Based on your current location, we will show you the next available public transit to take you wherever you want to go.

**Frontend:** The frontend is coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Bootstrap has been used for easy styling, and has been tweaked to be more clean/flat and to fit the takeme branding scheme. AngularJS is used for dynamic web content consumption.

**Experience:** I have had experience for several years with HTML and CSS. This is my first time writing javascript code. I chose to use AngularJS as it seemed a bit easier to pick up. Due to time constraints I could not abstract app.js out to seperate files based on controllers, factories, etc. Given more time I would have split app.js into several files.
